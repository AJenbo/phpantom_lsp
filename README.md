# PHPantomLSP

A PHP Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in Rust.

> **Note:** This project is in early development. Features are minimal.

## Features

- LSP lifecycle management (initialize, shutdown, document sync)
- Basic completion

## Building

```bash
cargo build

# or for a release build
cargo build --release
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Manual LSP Testing

The included `test_lsp.sh` script sends JSON-RPC messages to the server over stdin/stdout, exercising the full LSP protocol flow (initialize, open file, hover, completion, shutdown):

```bash
./test_lsp.sh
```

This is useful for verifying end-to-end behavior outside of an editor.

### Debugging

Enable logging by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run 2>phpantom.log
```

Logs are written to stderr, so redirect as needed.

## Editor Integration

PHPantomLSP communicates over stdin/stdout. Point your editor's LSP client at the binary:

- **Path:** `target/release/phpantom_lsp` (after `cargo build --release`)
