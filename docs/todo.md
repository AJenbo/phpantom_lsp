## Composer Environment Detection & Warnings

### 37. Warn when composer.json is missing or classmap is not optimized

PHPantom relies on Composer artifacts (`vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php`,
`autoload_psr4.php`, `autoload_files.php`) for class discovery. When these
are missing or incomplete, completions silently degrade. The user should be
told what's wrong and offered help fixing it.

#### Detection (during `initialized`)

| Condition | Severity | Message |
|---|---|---|
| No `composer.json` in workspace root | Warning | "No composer.json found. Class completions will be limited to open files and stubs." |

For the no-composer.json case, offer to generate a minimal one via
`window/showMessageRequest`:

1. **"Generate composer.json"** — create a `composer.json` that maps
   the entire project root as a classmap (`"autoload": {"classmap": ["./"]}`).
   Then run `composer dump-autoload -o` to build the classmap. This
   covers legacy projects and single-directory setups that don't follow
   PSR-4 conventions.
2. **"Dismiss"** — do nothing.

| `composer.json` exists but `vendor/` directory is missing | Warning | "No vendor directory found. Run `composer install` to enable full completions." |
| PSR-4 prefixes exist but no user classes in classmap | Info | "Composer classmap does not contain your project classes. Run `composer dump-autoload -o` for full class completions." |

The third condition needs care. The classmap is rarely empty because
vendor packages like PHPUnit use `classmap` autoloading (not PSR-4), so
there will be vendor entries even without `-o`. The real signal is:
the project's `composer.json` declares PSR-4 prefixes (e.g. `App\`,
`Tests\`), but none of the classmap FQNs start with any of those
project prefixes. This means the user's own classes were not dumped
into the classmap, which is exactly what `-o` fixes.

Detection logic:
1. Collect non-vendor PSR-4 prefixes from `psr4_mappings` (already
   tagged with `is_vendor`).
2. After loading the classmap, check whether any classmap FQN starts
   with one of those prefixes.
3. If there are project PSR-4 prefixes but zero matching classmap
   entries, the autoloader is not optimized.

#### Actions (via `window/showMessageRequest`)

For the non-optimized classmap case, offer action buttons:

1. **"Run composer dump-autoload -o"** — spawn the command in the
   workspace root, reload the classmap on success, show a progress
   notification.
2. **"Add to composer.json & run"** — add
   `"config": {"optimize-autoloader": true}` to `composer.json` so
   future `composer install` / `composer update` always produce an
   optimized classmap, then run `composer dump-autoload`.
3. **"Dismiss"** — do nothing.

#### UX guidelines

- The no-composer.json and no-vendor warnings are safe to show via
  `window/showMessage` (informational, no action taken).
- The classmap warning should use `window/showMessageRequest` with
  action buttons so the user explicitly opts in before we touch files
  or run commands.
- Only show once per session. Do not re-trigger on every `didOpen`.
- Never modify `composer.json` or run commands without explicit user
  confirmation via an action button.
- If the spawned `composer` command fails (e.g. PHP not installed
  locally, Docker-only setup), catch the error gracefully and show
  "Composer command failed. You may need to run it manually."
- Log the detection result to the output panel regardless (already done
  for the "Loaded N classmap entries" message, just add context when
  zero user classes are found).

### 38. File system watching for vendor and project changes

PHPantom loads Composer artifacts (classmap, PSR-4 mappings, autoload
files) once during `initialized` and caches them for the session. If
the user runs `composer update`, `composer require`, or `composer remove`
while the editor is open, the cached data goes stale. The user gets
completions and go-to-definition based on the old package versions
until they restart the editor.

#### What to watch

| Path | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` | Changed | Reload classmap |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` | Changed | Reload PSR-4 mappings |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_files.php` | Changed | Re-scan autoload files for global functions/constants |
| `composer.json` | Changed | Reload project PSR-4 prefixes, re-check vendor dir |
| `composer.lock` | Changed | Good secondary signal that packages changed |

All three `autoload_*.php` files are rewritten atomically by Composer
on every `install`, `update`, `require`, `remove`, and `dump-autoload`.
Watching these is sufficient to catch any package change.

#### Implementation options

1. **LSP `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`** — register file watchers
   via `client/registerCapability` during `initialized`. The editor
   handles the OS-level watching and sends notifications. This is the
   cleanest approach and works cross-platform. Register glob patterns
   for the vendor Composer files and `composer.json`.

2. **Server-side `notify` crate** — use the `notify` Rust crate to
   watch the file system directly. More control but adds a dependency
   and duplicates what the editor already provides.

Option 1 is preferred. The LSP spec's `DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions`
supports glob patterns like `**/vendor/composer/autoload_*.php`.

#### Reload strategy

- On change notification, re-run the same parsing logic from
  `initialized` for the affected artifact.
- Invalidate `class_index` entries that came from vendor files (their
  parsed AST may have changed).
- Clear and re-populate `classmap` from the new `autoload_classmap.php`.
- Log the reload to the output panel so the user knows it happened.
- Debounce rapid changes (Composer writes multiple files in sequence)
  with a short delay (e.g. 500ms) to avoid redundant reloads.

## Completion & Go-to-Definition Gaps

### Competitive parity (close the gap with PHPStorm / Intelephense)

#### 32. No namespace-segment completion in `use` import statements

When typing `use App\Models\`, the class name completion path offers
full class FQNs that match the prefix. It does not offer intermediate
namespace segments as standalone suggestions (e.g. offering `Models\`
as a navigable segment when typing `use App\`).

Most PHP LSPs show namespace segments as folder-like completions so the
user can incrementally drill into the namespace tree. PHPantom jumps
straight to full class names, which works but can be overwhelming in
large projects with deep namespace hierarchies.

---

#### 21. No reverse jump: implementation → interface method declaration

Go-to-implementation lets you jump from an interface method to its concrete
implementations, but there is no way to jump from a concrete implementation
*back* to the interface or abstract method it satisfies.  For example,
clicking `handle()` in a class that `implements Handler` cannot jump to
`Handler::handle()`.

This would be a natural extension of `find_declaring_class` in
`definition/member.rs`: when the cursor is on a method *definition* (not
a call), check whether any implemented interface or parent abstract class
declares a method with the same name, and offer that as a definition
target.

---

### Remaining by user need

#### 27. No completion inside string interpolation

Inside double-quoted strings with variable interpolation, member access
completion does not work. PHP supports `"Hello $user->name"` and
`"Hello {$user->getName()}"`, but the completion handler has no
string-interpolation awareness. The subject extraction may accidentally
work in trivial cases but is not reliable because the surrounding quote
characters can confuse offset calculation and the patched content.

```php
$greeting = "Hello {$user->}";
//                         ^ no completion
```

---

#### 20. Non-`$this` property access in text-based assignment path

In `extract_raw_type_from_assignment_text` (`completion/text_resolution.rs`),
property access on the RHS is only handled for `$this->propName`.  When
the RHS is `$otherVar->propName`, it falls through to `None`:

```php
$user = getUser();
$address = $user->address;  // text-based path returns None
$address->  // ← no completion (unless the AST-based path catches it)
```

The AST-based path in `resolve_rhs_expression` handles this correctly,
so the gap only surfaces in the text-based fallback used for intermediate
chained assignments and some edge cases.

**Fix:** after the `$this->propName` check, add a branch that resolves
`$var->propName` by first resolving `$var`'s type via
`extract_raw_type_from_assignment_text` (recursively), then looking up
the property on the resulting class.

---

#### 34 / 36. No go-to-definition for built-in (stub) functions and constants

Clicking on a built-in function name like `array_map`, `strlen`, or
`json_decode` does not navigate anywhere. `resolve_function_definition`
finds the function in `stub_function_index` and caches it under a
synthetic `phpantom-stub-fn://` URI, but then explicitly skips navigation
because the URI is not a real file path. The same applies to built-in
constants like `PHP_EOL`, `SORT_ASC`, `PHP_INT_MAX` — they exist in
`stub_constant_index` for completion but `resolve_constant_definition`
only checks `global_defines`.

User-defined functions and `define()` constants work correctly. Only
built-in PHP symbols from stubs are affected.

**Fix:** either embed the stub source files as navigable resources (e.g.
write them to a temporary directory and use real file URIs), or accept
that stub go-to-definition is out of scope and document it as a known
limitation.

---

#### 33. Generator yield type not inferred inside generator bodies

When a method is annotated `@return Generator<int, User>`, the yield
value type (`User`) is correctly extracted when iterating the generator
with `foreach`. However, *inside* the generator body itself, there is
no inference from the declared return type back to the yielded values.

```php
class UserRepository {
    /** @return \Generator<int, User> */
    public function findAll(): \Generator {
        // Inside this body, `$user` should be typed as User
        // based on the Generator return annotation, but it isn't.
        yield $user;
        $user->  // ← no completion
    }
}
```

This is a niche scenario (the developer writing the generator usually
knows the types), but it would help when the generator body grows large
and variables are passed around before being yielded.

---

#### 35. Union completion: sort intersection members above branch-only members

When a variable has a union type (e.g. `User|AdminUser` from a match or
ternary), the completion list shows all members from all types (see
"Union Type Completion" in ARCHITECTURE.md for the design rationale).
Members that only exist on a subset of the union already display the
originating class in the `detail` field, but nothing else distinguishes
them from members shared by all types.

A small UX improvement: after collecting all completion items, do a
post-processing pass that counts how many of the resolved classes each
member appeared on. Members present on all types (the intersection)
would keep their current sort position. Members present on only some
types would be sorted lower via `sort_text` and could get a marker in
`label_details` (e.g. the originating class name as a suffix).

This keeps everything visible (no completions are removed) but nudges
the developer toward type-safe choices first.

## Go-to-Implementation Gaps

### 5b. Short-name collisions in `find_implementors`
**Priority: Low**

`class_implements_or_extends` matches interfaces by both short name and
FQN (`iface_short == target_short || iface == target_fqn`).  Two
interfaces in different namespaces with the same short name (e.g.
`App\Logger` and `Vendor\Logger`) could produce false positives.
Similarly, `seen_names` in `find_implementors` deduplicates by short
name, so two classes with the same short name in different namespaces
could shadow each other.

**Fix:** always compare fully-qualified names by resolving both sides
before comparison.

---

## Missing LSP Features

### 6. Hover (`textDocument/hover`)
**Priority: High**

No hover support at all. Users can't see inferred types, docblock descriptions,
or method signatures by hovering. Most of the infrastructure already exists
(type resolution, class loading, docblocks) — wiring it into a hover handler
would be relatively straightforward and high-impact.

---

### 7. Signature Help (`textDocument/signatureHelp`)
**Priority: Medium**

No parameter hints shown while typing function/method arguments. Named arg
completion partially fills this role, but proper signature help is more
ergonomic.

---

### 8. Document Symbols (`textDocument/documentSymbol`)
**Priority: Medium**

No outline view. Editors can't show a file's class/method/property structure.

---

### 9. Find References (`textDocument/references`)
**Priority: Medium**

Can't find all usages of a symbol.

---

### 10. Rename (`textDocument/rename`)
**Priority: Low**

No rename refactoring support.

---

### 11. Workspace Symbols (`workspace/symbol`)
**Priority: Low**

Can't search for classes/functions across the project.

---

### 12. Diagnostics
**Priority: Low** (large scope)

No error reporting (undefined methods, type mismatches, etc.).

---

### 13. Code Actions
**Priority: Low**

No quick fixes or refactoring suggestions. No `codeActionProvider` in
`ServerCapabilities`, no `textDocument/codeAction` handler, and no
`WorkspaceEdit` generation infrastructure beyond trivial `TextEdit`s for
use-statement insertion.

#### 13a. Extract Function refactoring

Select a range of statements inside a method/function and extract them into a
new function. The LSP would need to:

1. **Scope analysis** — determine which variables are read in the selection but
   defined before it (→ parameters) and which are written in the selection but
   read after it (→ return values).
2. **Statement boundary validation** — reject selections that split an
   expression or cross control-flow boundaries in invalid ways.
3. **Type annotation** — use variable type resolution to generate parameter and
   return type hints on the new function.
4. **Code generation** — produce a `WorkspaceEdit` that replaces the selection
   with a call and inserts the new function definition nearby.

**Prerequisites (build these first):**

| Feature | What it contributes |
|---|---|
| Hover (§6) | "Resolve type at arbitrary position" — needed to type params |
| Document Symbols (§8) | AST range → symbol mapping — needed to find enclosing function and valid insertion points |
| Find References (§9) | Variable usage tracking across a scope — the same "which variables are used where" analysis |
| Simple code actions (add use stmt, implement interface) | Builds the code action + `WorkspaceEdit` plumbing |

---

## Performance / UX Ideas

### 14. Partial result streaming via `$/progress`
**Priority: Medium** (cross-cutting optimisation)

The LSP spec (3.17) allows requests that return arrays — such as
`textDocument/implementation`, `textDocument/references`,
`workspace/symbol`, and even `textDocument/completion` — to stream
incremental batches of results via `$/progress` notifications when both
sides negotiate a `partialResultToken`.  The final RPC response then
carries `null` (all items were already sent through progress).

This would let PHPantom deliver the *first* useful results almost
instantly instead of blocking until every source has been scanned.

#### Streaming between existing phases

`find_implementors` already runs five sequential phases (see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § Go-to-Implementation):

1. **Phase 1 — ast_map** (already-parsed classes in memory) — essentially
   free.  Flush results immediately.
2. **Phase 2 — class_index** (FQN → URI entries not yet in ast_map) —
   loads individual files.  Flush after each batch.
3. **Phase 3 — classmap files** (Composer classmap, user + vendor mixed)
   — iterates unique file paths, applies string pre-filter, parses
   matches.  This is the widest phase and the best candidate for
   within-phase streaming (see below).
4. **Phase 4 — embedded stubs** (string pre-filter → lazy parse) — flush
   after stubs are checked.
5. **Phase 5 — PSR-4 directory walk** (user code only, catches files not
   in the classmap) — disk I/O + parse per file, good candidate for
   per-file streaming.

Each phase boundary is a natural point to flush a `$/progress` batch,
so the editor starts populating the results list while heavier phases
are still running.

#### Prioritising user code within Phase 3

Phase 3 iterates the Composer classmap, which contains both user and
vendor entries.  Currently they are processed in arbitrary order.  A
simple optimisation: partition classmap file paths into user paths
(under PSR-4 roots from `composer.json` `autoload` / `autoload-dev`)
and vendor paths (everything else, typically under `vendor/`), then
process user paths first.  This way the results most relevant to the
developer arrive before vendor matches, even within a single phase.

#### Granularity options

- **Per-phase batches** (simplest) — one `$/progress` notification at
  each of the five phase boundaries listed above.
- **Per-file streaming** — within Phases 3 and 5, emit results as each
  file is parsed from disk instead of waiting for the entire phase to
  finish.  Phase 3 can iterate hundreds of classmap files and Phase 5
  recursively walks PSR-4 directories, so per-file flushing would
  significantly improve perceived latency for large projects.
- **Adaptive batching** — collect results for a short window (e.g. 50 ms)
  then flush, balancing notification overhead against latency.

#### Applicable requests

| Request | Benefit |
|---|---|
| `textDocument/implementation` | Already scans five phases; each phase's matches can be streamed |
| `textDocument/references` (§9) | Will need full-project scanning; streaming is essential |
| `workspace/symbol` (§11) | Searches every known class/function; early batches feel instant |
| `textDocument/completion` | Less critical (usually fast), but long chains through vendor code could benefit |

#### Implementation sketch

1. Check whether the client sent a `partialResultToken` in the request
   params.
2. If yes, create a `$/progress` sender.  After each scan phase (or
   per-file, depending on granularity), send a
   `ProgressParams { token, value: [items...] }` notification.
3. Return `null` as the final response.
4. If no token was provided, fall back to the current behaviour: collect
   everything, return once.
