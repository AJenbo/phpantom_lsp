//! Where an offset sits in PHP source, resolved by a single forward scan.
//!
//! Completion needs three things about the text leading up to a cursor: the
//! string literal the cursor is typing in, if any (so the key in
//! `route('name', ['us|` is known to start after that quote), the last byte of
//! real code before it (so that key is still seen to follow a `[` across
//! `route('name', [ // note (here)\n '|'`), and the chain of brackets left
//! open at it (so the `[` of an argument array and the `(` of the call it
//! belongs to can be told apart from any other nesting).  Each open bracket
//! carries the commas seen inside it and where the code before it ends, which
//! is the argument index and the callee of the call it opens, plus the
//! `->` / `?->` / `::` immediately before that callee, if any, so the
//! receiver in front of it can be read from a comment-free boundary too.
//!
//! All of it comes out of one forward pass.  A backwards walk cannot answer
//! any of them: read from the right, a `//`, a `#`, or a quote is ambiguous
//! (it may open a comment, sit inside a string, or close one), so a stray
//! bracket or apostrophe inside a comment unbalances the walk.  Scanning
//! forward the lexical state is unambiguous, and tracking the open brackets
//! on the way gives the enclosing constructs directly.
