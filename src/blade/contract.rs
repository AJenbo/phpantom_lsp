//! A template's merged contract, and what a caller may hand it.
//!
//! [`super::signature`] reads what one template declares. This module
//! answers the two questions a caller has to be judged against:
//!
//! * **What must I pass?** A template and the layouts it `@extends` render
//!   from one data array, so the contract is the union of their signatures,
//!   nearest declaration winning (a child may narrow what a layout declared,
//!   which is the covariant merge Bladestan performs). Names some other
//!   source supplies (a component's backing class, a provider's shared or
//!   composed data, Blade's own component scope) are recorded separately:
//!   they are part of the template's scope but no caller has to pass them.
//!   Those sources are read per level of the chain, since the layout that
//!   declares a name is usually the one a composer is registered on.
//! * **What may I pass?** Blade hands a template's whole data array on to
//!   every template it renders from the same data, so a name the template
//!   itself never mentions may still be destined for a partial it
//!   `@include`s. The accepted set is therefore the transitive closure of
//!   the templates reachable from it, and it is only *closed* when every
//!   view name on the way is a readable literal.
//!
//! Both are computed from raw Blade source, so a template that has never
//! been opened or preprocessed can still be judged.
