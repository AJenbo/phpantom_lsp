//! The variables a template inherits from the layout it `@extends`.
//!
//! A child and its layout render from one data array: Laravel compiles
//! `@extends('layouts.app')` into a footer that renders `layouts.app` with
//! the very data the child was given. So whatever the layout declares it
//! needs, the child is handed too, and a `@var` written once in a layout
//! types every template under it without anyone redeclaring it.
//!
//! The child stays in charge of its own names. A name its own signature
//! declares keeps the child's type (the preprocessor never re-declares a
//! signature name), so the child may narrow what the layout declared but
//! cannot have it widened underneath, which is the covariant merge
//! Bladestan performs. The chain is walked all the way up, nearest layout
//! first, so a name a grandparent layout declares reaches the child as
//! well.
